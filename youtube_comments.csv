4,@Elver_Galarga_jugo,The faster turn signal blinks come off as lower quality. Feels like they cheaped out on the sequential relay and thats why it blinks quicker. Alot like how people get cheap sequential kots for older mustangs and they blonk too fast.,2024-08-20T07:44:51Z,0

Curious to know the  prformance numbers on an almost 500 HP GT...should be over 450 HP.  Also curious  about what  kind of  cameras  and ""drive assist modes"" it will have. Will it borrow from the explorer's tech e.g. 350 camera view, front and back parking sensors and  full -auto park??  On a Gt? Why not....the tech is there, tested and works. there might be parking situations  where ""full auto park""  might come in handy...

Also there's no distinction between the premium trim versus the base trim in the 2024 GTs while in the previous models you had to upgrade to the premium model to option in the 401a package which is a pro and a con to whomever you're asking.

The 2024 here seems diminished: almost like they are bowing to gen z with the Ipad screens all over the inside as well as the simplistic plastic styling. The outside has the same issue. The styling has gone from baddass to plastic cuts, it just seems like its one step away from being an electric mustang. Look at the interior of the 2020 Shelby GT350 and it is old school handsome muscle. I dont want to be bothered by computer graphics and light bothering my line of vision while I am trying to drive.

However the Ford Mustang is one of the coolest cars ever. Excluding the models made from 1974 until 1993... they look lame. However the Mustang before that and the Mustang after that are just... SUCH A COOL DESIGN, MAN!!!

It’s time to put FORD and 21st century carburetor/manifold technology to the forefront of all Sport-HYBRIDs on market today.
 If they can do that, then I’d like to see it tested on the NASCAR circuit and possibly Formula1. I hope you are up to the engineering challenges, especially since you invented the automobile.  I recommend re-enforcing your ENGINEERING team with more German engineers until USA education becomes #1 worldwide. Remember FORD, you can have your cake and eat it too, if you put the other American Automaker Engineers to shame with their lack of new innovations in over 30+years of automobile technology.  You can make far superior supercharged intake manifolds and carburetors that only consume a coffee cup of gasoline, imagine a 5.0 GT HYBRID MUSTANG that not even corvette’s nor hellcat’s can even touch.  Make it so intriguing that even highway patrol will place orders for this nationwide, HYBRIDS are the future so let’s make a reality.",2023-02-12T22:22:15Z,0

Well, the classic mustang ""double hump"" dashboard is gone and destroyed ...replaced by a luxury sedan wide screen TV. It's not an improvement. Completely ruins the feel, now it's quite frankly any brands bland sedan.  There are certain design elements that tie an iconic brand together. The new dashboard design has lost any recognizable Mustang cues. Idea: Turn the centre console to the vertical, and let that be your infotainment centre. Leave the digital speed and tach in place from the outgoing model. I get the feeling that whoever signed off on these design changes...has no tie to the Mustang's history. I just want to rip out the dashboard and replace it with the outgoing models design....it really is that bad. *waiting for the redesign in three...two...*  *sigh* - You had ONE job Ford... 5 out of 10.",2023-02-02T15:41:29Z,0

Then you noticed the interior and NOW we see they moved the ""electric"" stuff into the dash for the time being. Really feels out of place. I thought I was inside a mercedes/kia hybrid for a second. If you want to do digital gauges keep the gauge cluster and just make the round face digital like dodge did with the later vipers.

Sync isn’t as good as it’s made to be, and climate control through the screen is massively annoying. While driving you have to mount your hand on the plastic beside the screen just to correctly click. And I can tell just by looking at it it’s not an oled. So they couldn’t even spend like the extra 300 dollars to put an actual nice panel in it. I am sad to see physical tachs leave and it feels weird when they put all the retro throwbacks in but meaning you’re looking at some dumb overthought screens that have mid level panels.",2022-12-19T15:46:34Z,0
900,@enginepy,Some nice design elements but it’s just looks weak. The haunches are not there. Needs a more widebody look in the fenders to give it a more muscular looks. Maybe it’ll look better in person. Wheels are also very weak looking. Like a base model. Headlights are nice. Lots of plastic on that rear defuser. The drivers screen has a huge bezel edge on it; not awesome and looks a bit cheap compared to other cars that use screens. I think it’ll be good for people used to mustang quality cars but it’s not going to impress anyone who used to higher end cars.,2022-12-19T10:33:26Z,0

I guess that's why the Mustang logo is a prancing horse with only two hooves on the ground.

Living in the snow belt region I would love to own one. If the 2.3 is anything like the engine in my MKZ. I’ll definitely take it. My Lincoln pin’s me in my seat. Sometimes I forget just how fast it is. It’s the fastest 4 I ever owned. I traded my MKZ 6 in for the 4. My car has the AWD. I love my car. It’s the Lincoln MKZ AWD RESERVE. The seats are perfect for my serious back problems. If they’re offering an outrageous price on the Mustang than I won’t buy it. To me, this Mustang looks more aggressive & looks longer.

From reactions I've seen this might be an unpopular opinion but it's basically a front and rear facelift and a dash refresh. They didn't even bother to update the door panels or center console at all. I can't find pics of the standard seats anywhere yet but judging from the rear seats it looks like they are recycling all the seats as well. Kind of surprised they even changed the steering wheel. Not entirely sure I'd call this a whole new generation. maybe an s550 v3.,2022-10-16T04:52:31Z,0

He almost became a mopar guy, he wanted a plymouth roadrunner, but ford just had the cheaper, working man's car. Mustangs are so underrated, so many people look down on them  who are Chevy guys, or European/Japanese sports car owners (i also love Toyotas and Hondas), but the mustang really did start it all. The first of the pony cars and without it, we would've never gotten the Camaro, or the the Challenger. You also gotta respect ford because the founder of Toyota literally learned how to perfect his assembly line by traveling to Detroit and studying the Ford assembly line. So in a sense, we may not have Toyotas today without Ford. You gotta respect Ford, a workhorse from day one, always producing good stuff, always innovating and setting trends.

I don’t want to feel like I’m staring at an iPad while driving. A sleek analogue gauge cluster and just a well-integrated smaller touchscreen will always look way nicer to me.

Please, Ford's people, have a second versión interior panel cluster analogue type. Or reduce screens sizes and instale them as inside of a frame of vynil structure, not like it is shown, they look like they have been  _put over_ without style and charme. 
What about chrome? Why Mustsng never has chrome parts? For example, a little lines in hand lock, bumpers (as mirror of grille and headlights). Chinese cars is tendence, also Peugeot and Citroën in France.

1925,@DWH300,"This new S650 is attractive but aggressive front to rear. The interior has finally been brought into the 21st century with amazing gauges and infotainment center along with a better overall design with the addition of soft touch materials. Even a drift brake developed by pro drifter Vaughn Gitten was added for those into drifting. The new dual throttle body Gen 4 Coyote should be a great addition. I noticed on the tach the redline was 7500 RPMs, plus a dual Ram Air system that runs to each side of the front grill. Even the new EcoBoost has added a electronic turbo and I'm guessing similar horsepower as the current HPP offers. Also kudos to Ford for teaming up with Multimatic for creating their new GT3 factory race team. It's possible with class changes in IMSA. The new GT3 S650 might compete against the C8 Z06. Ford will also offer the GT4 S650 and the new NHRA X class drag racing Mustang for Privateer racers. Thanks to Ford for keeping the V8 alive and well. There's even rumors the Shelby GT500 will continue through model year 2024 as an S550. Disappearing for one year in model year 2025 while reappearing as an S650 for model year 2026.

Many of the older audience can't stand it (look back at the Fusion around 13-14 and you see that they went back and added knobs due to the number of negative comments on electronic controls). Too bad because the rest of the car is killer. They should look at the RAM interior to see how a minimalist tablet cluster can live in harmony with switches and knobs.

2365,@benjaminkuhn3688,What's even more incredible about the new Mustang is that Ford developed a GT3 version to compete and showcase their level of engineering against other competitors. How cool would it be to see a Mustang GT3 compete against a Corvette GT3 at Le Mans. We all know Dodge (or FIAT) doesn't have the R&D to build a race car that could compete at a worldly level against the likes of a Porsche or any other European manufacturer for that matter.  They can't even figure out their own anti-deterrent system with all the stolen Chargers/Challengers LOL!,2022-09-21T04:24:00Z,0

2368,@bequrious,I don’t wanna come off as a hater but I didn’t care for neither the interior nor the exterior. This does look more muscular on the sides and kinda like a street race car from the back probably because of the spoiler. The previous model looked more smooth and exotic. It is kinda hard to explain. I love the black panel between the tail lights on the previous model which made the silver horse logo stand out more. I am sad to see they got rid of that. I don’t care for this ruffles crinkle cut looking back at all and small tail lights like that made it not stand out in my opinion . Also I agree with everyone saying that it looks like a Camaro and I don’t care for Camaros . The interior on this one looks cheap and chewy to me. I definitely didn’t care for the light gray interior and basic looking dashboard. The steering wheel looks incredibly basic and old like the late 90s Chevy impalas. I guess I just need to take very good care of my 2020 CV eco boost since I love how it looks inside and out. Interior is much classier and love the sturdy aggressive look of the steering wheel with the large silver horse and having analog screen is nice and I like the digital screen being lower and ac unit just looks much more modern and sleek in my opinion. Maybe it would grow on me over time but these are my thoughts as of now. Please don’t attack me for expressing myself. I love mustangs in general and it was always a dream of mine to own one and I do now and I feel great about that. No I am not a teenager. Just a very responsible driver who loves American muscle 💪🥰,2022-09-21T04:16:33Z,0

If you believe and repent of your sins and put your faith and trust in Him as you would a parachute jumping off a plane at 25000 feet up in the air, He will give you eternal life in heaven as a free gift and I promise you, He will change your life forever as He did mine. He is the ONLY way to heaven and He loves you all. Please think deeply about this with urgency because this is your eternal life and soul, you don’t know when you could die, meaning you could die at any moment, so please consider this with all your heart. If anyone tells you that Jesus isn’t the only way, they are lying to you and they don’t care about your future. Thx for reading.",2022-09-20T15:30:31Z,0

The tac and gauge cluster just seems too gimmicky, and the interior looks so slimmed down it doesn't have the needed oomph. Chiseled? Sure, too much? Definitely.

The new Mustang displays are actually based on ""Unreal"" graphics, a 3D rendering company that a lot of high end realistic video games are based on. That's pretty cool for us tech geeks. The Brembo brakes can be optioned with different colors and badges. The seat belts can also be optioned with different colors. The new 5.0 will come with dual throttle botties. Each throttle body has separate ducts going to the front grills, similar to a ""ram"" air intake.  The new 2.3 Eco boost now has an electronic VGT turbo. Also, for me, the remote revs would be useful for testing different exhaust or mufflers without needing someone in the car to blip the throttle.",2022-09-19T14:31:45Z,5

All jokes aside if you go to 7:35 and look at the famous “dual hump” design and have even the tiniest bit of imagination you can see how they could have kept that dual hump AND made bigger screens work. Not that they’re necessary.  Now the interior looks a freakin model 3 or Prius. Good job Ford.  How they saw that design and gave it an “Ok” is beyond me.,2022-09-19T04:16:50Z,1

Those rear tail lights are nasty (in the worst possible way) and the front end grill and headlights look like they belong on an EV not a v8 petrol muscle car. It's a little bit cringe that they completely copied the hood intake/cutout from the Camaro as well, Chev bought that shit out in 2019, it doesn't exactly scream innovation.

The front looks great, a respectful and modern evolution of the previous model. The back of the car looks very interesting. There is a whopping and unapologetic crease.

The interior has broken the bounds of the low quality that typically limits American muscle cars. Huge win. I'm kinda picky, but I would appreciate if they had an interior tier where you can buy OLED screens and/or a faster processor for the OS... would really seal the deal there, but that may require unreasonable effort to develop. Who knows how difficult it is to implement that somewhat new technology, with screen burnout (though perhaps replaceable), the logistical issues of producing and offering more options, and other problems.

Bigger, better engines are as expected 😁 Sounds awesome!  A stronger and tighter rev, yet still characteristically Mustang rumble as the engine slows down. And with the improvement in handling from the 5th to the 6th generation in mind, we should have some great things to expect from this generation. Looking forward to seeing these things out in the streets! And maybe in my garage 🫢😆 God willing.",2022-09-18T03:21:20Z,53

Thankful they didn't go all-capacitive buttons like VW did with the disastrous new Golf R.   I do wish they'd kept minimal physical climate controls, perhaps just small left/right dials that showed temperature, and you could push them in to bring up an on-screen menu for more settings.

1. Ninety-nine percent of lawyers give the rest a bad name.
2. On the other hand, you have different fingers..
3. If we aren’t supposed to eat animals, why are they made with meat?
4. Nothing is fool proof to a sufficiently talented fool.
5. Nuke the Whales.
6. I started out with nothing and I still have most of it.
7. I took an IQ test and the results were negative.
8. Okay, who stopped the payment on my reality check? 
9. My mind is like a steel trap, rusty and illegal in 37 states.
10. I’ve only been wrong once, and that’s when I thought I was wrong.

 Editorial: Perhaps the world's most thought-provoking one-liner is ""Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway."" It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, ""Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart."" Ever looked with lust? If you have said ""Yes"" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: ""God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."" Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com",2022-09-17T19:41:15Z,0

3735,@clencheastwood1571,"I find the different philosophies that companies have about digital displays interesting.  IMO, you want some that looks good, but timeless, with a crisp image and responsive menus because this car is going to be driver by someone for the next 20+ years and that display needs to hold up if you're going to justify having it.  Ford does exactly this, I think, and others cars with cheaper displays will feel even cheaper in the future and loss more value in the second hand market as a result.",2022-09-17T14:01:59Z,0

What disappointed me the most was the front part of the car it completely lost its aggressiveness and it looks forcibly futuristic, the rear part looks like a Camaro for me, this car lost all the essence of Mustang.

3758,@adamhose5231,"Well first and foremost I'm extremely disappointed that Doug didn't get in the back seats...☹️
But aside from that I really like the body of this new Mustang. I've owned a couple Camaros and I've never owned a Mustang although we've had a couple in my family and so I like both Camaros and Mustangs. However I have been disappointed with the last couple generations of Camaros because of the poor visibility and unnecessary high non-erodynamic front end.  But I've been disappointed with Mustang this last generation because you couldn't get a sunroof and it's so cheesy to pump in fake engine sound through the speakers. As far as Motors are concerned I've had a few LS Motors and I've had a few 5.0 coyotes in my F-150s and both are excellent Motors although I'm a little partial to the older 5.7 LS engines and the 5.0 Coyote engine because they get better fuel mileage than the 6.2 L. And I know people will be like who cares about fuel mileage, but I like to cruise in the low triple digits for extended periods which is why I like these cars because they're excellent sport touring cars and at those speeds better aerodynamics and a more fuel efficient motor makes the experience more enjoyable so you're not hunting for a gas station every couple hundred miles. Anyway this is a really beautiful looking mustang, love the body, I hope they put in a sunroof, I could do without the rear wing because again for the reason I buy these cars it will just cut into fuel mileage, and I like the screens but I do wish they were a little more integrated looking. Anyway, well done!",2022-09-17T13:02:59Z,0

3824,@ChrisRogersTheAngryChef,"Best Mustang review out there right now, that's why Doug makes the big bucks. I gotta say, although I've never been a Mustang fan- too big and heavy for me, It's very obvious American car manufacturers like Ford and GM know their customers. The little details they add are fantastic and custom tailored to a specific person. For example; all Corvettes have always been able to easily carry two sets of golf clubs in the trunk, Porsche cannot. Just as many Porsche owners golf but they leave this feature out and charge double. This Ford comes with a manual as STANDARD, the Toyota Supra left that out until 2023 and it's a rare option. In conclusion, sometimes these foreign companies just make stupid decisions on a large scale (no Yaris in North America, new Acura Integra, etc) and Ford and GM look like marketing geniuses (Bronco, C8 Z06, Gladiator, etc). Did Europe and Japan just stop thinking entirely? Ford made only minor changes to the Mustang because it sells like crazy, revolutionary design is a historical risk for this model, (GM knew it was the only place left to go with Corvette) they know that. This new one will sell out. It's nice to see US companies still consumer friendly, it's so rare these days.",2022-09-17T07:38:51Z,0

4076,@swagger897,"I just bought a 2020 Mustang this year and have enjoyed it tremendously so far. I'll make this comment now to see how I feel about it several years from now and see how the new car ages, but for starters the gauge cluster is not appealing at all to the one I have now. The ""tablet"" look that most cars are having where the infotainment displays aren't ""built-in"" to the dashboards does not look appealing, but rather an afterthought. Aside from that, the display itself has a lot of empty space and seems too much for having too little. Everything is crammed in to one location with the corners or outside areas exposed with nothing. It could've been consolidated to seem more appealing but alas we'll see. The one thing I notice with my display is everything seems to be well filled out, nothing hard to find or see, with both important information wrapping around the screen and secondary information located elsewhere. 

Interested to see how the GT500 is developed from this, as well as if we're getting a GT350. Hopefully ford goes out with a bang on both of these models and includes one with an optional Terminator engine option.",2022-09-16T19:22:32Z,0

I know the knuckledraggers out there have to have their displacement but really.

People will either repent and believe in Jesus of Nazareth thus entering into the Kingdom of God (1 Co. 15:1-4, John 3:16, John 3:3 John 14:6, Romans 5:21, Titus 3:3-7) or worship the beast and his image and be cast alive into the lake of fire with the beast, false prophet and devil where they will be tormented 'for ever and ever’ in ‘a lake of fire burning with brimstone.”  (Rev. 13:16-18, Rev. 14:9-11, Rev 19:20, Rev. 20:10) 

(KJV Ephesians 2:8-9) “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.”

(KJV Romans 6:22-23) ""But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."" 

(KJV Titus 3:5) “Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;”

(KJV 1 Corinthians 15:56-57) ""The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.  But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."" 

(KJV Romans 8:2) ""For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death."" 

(KJV John 3:16-18) ""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.""

(KJV Rev 13:16-17) ""And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."" 

(KJV Rev 19:20) ""And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.""

(KJV Rev 21:8) ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burnets with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.”",2022-09-16T17:43:03Z,0

The worst, the big tacked-on infotainment screens!  WTF Ford?!  This look sucks in a Mercedes and looks even more out of place (or half-azzd) in a sport oriented Mustang.  Leave,it for the trucks and the electric golf cart.  Ya could have shaped the driver’s screen to a classic dash form then left the center screen as a tack on if you must.  See new Audi 3 cars (A platform) for the current best application of in dash screens.  However, any improvement in interior build and materials is a win over the previous cheap plastic parts in some touch spots.

Sorry, from first blush, the car just seems like a mish-mosh patchwork of design themes; more awkward than cohesive.  The saving grace of course is the fabulous NA 5.0 V8 engine, manual transmission and rowdy real exhaust.  Long live the V8, long live ICE’s!!",2022-09-16T03:58:58Z,1

He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.

Maybe Chevy will make a Camaro that looks like a Mustang from the side?

 My only problem is the Ecoboost engine. Why has everyone abandoned V6s? 

 The Ecoboost is not a good design and will eventually ‘blow up’ especially after the warranty expires….

 If they want to make something to improve their CAFE NUMBERS, they should make a Mustang hybrid so that it runs on electric power till the battery runs down then the motor kicks in and the engine will be a normally aspirated 4 cylinder engine….

Its unfortunate because the rest looks great, although this looks 100% like a sports car body. Respect for them continuing the Mustang, but id take a current gen personally as best case this has like 50 more hp to hit 500 lol. Literally the buttons and steering wheel changed. I can tell just by this video the seats are maybe 5% more comfortable they are the same recaro seats with more perforation.. woah.

6.75/10 for a new generation Mustang imo. They really put no thought into this and just shared parts with the Bronco.",2022-09-15T23:39:57Z,1

But even with that being said, and as much as I'll miss those features, I frankly like this design more than anything I've seen from the model since the outgoing 2004 versions, which I still own. Despite the missing  profile details on the exterior, this is the meanest, beefiest design I think I've ever seen on a Mustang, and I love it, especially the front end and the angular taillight panels. 

The interior....well, the missing scoops are a bummer, and I'm still not used to cars being dominated by screens, but overall, it's a great looking interior I think. And the main thing is it just doesn't look as plasticky and cheap as older models did. My aforementioned 2004 GT, as much as I love it, has the cheapest most outdated interior imaginable even by 2004 standards, so I love what I'm seeing here.

I guess the performance aspect is what’ll win me over since we know it’ll have magnaride which should be better than current gen. along with how much more expensive this will be with all the goodies installed,2022-09-15T21:26:07Z,0

Its the way alot of sutomakers are intergrating the screens into the dash like in this case. It looks like they just stuck a tablet to the dadh and i think that always looks terrible!

The headlights are some sort of weird mashup between the 2015 design and Mach-E headlights, which I don’t think is as good as the previous generations gill like tri bar headlights. The interior is honestly just ugly. The middle of the steering wheel looks like it was chiseled out of a rock, and the large screens are just an eyesore, and the air vents are moved to a way less convenient place then the previous generation. The fox body style gauges and the drift mode are pretty cool, but the loss of physical gauges is an L. I know people put a lot of work into this design, but it looks like they threw the old S550 into photoshop, maxed out the sharpness level and called it a day. I don’t hate it, but it’s just not as good as the previous 2018+ design. I don’t like ranting in comment sections, but I had to put this somewhere.😅",2022-09-15T18:01:12Z,0

6042,@2nd-place,"I like it. Nice update. Ford gets the interior screens and how to make them fast and responsive and customizable. I'm not crazy about climate controls on the touch screen, though.

I am disappointed about the rumors not panning out. I had heard that it would have two front motors and a smaller battery for front wheel drive battery mode around town, which would be great right now with gas prices and the fact that the planet is dying. Then there was rumored to be an option to use it in conjunction with the V8 rear wheel drive in a lower power state to have AWD when losing grip which is great for the area where I live that gets a lot of snow, and the option to use it in a higher level performance mode combining the V8 with the motors to have great traction off the line and get even crazier 0-60 times.

Oh well. Maybe in a few years I will be able to buy that version! I like the idea of being able to have a rumbly V8 that I use occasionally but have electric motors that are good for the planet when commuting around or for helping improve mileage on road trips.",2022-09-15T17:58:17Z,1

It looks like the team responsible for it is just a project group from highschool that forgot that they had to turn in their group homework and just rushed something out : the design just look like a caricature of the outgoing model, you even lose the round headlight design, and the classic double cockpit design (because of course it's easier to just throw an ugly and giant iPad in there), just throw better quality plastics, cool badges, 10 more hp and voilà, let's call it a 7th gen. I'm glad this car still exists and that it still has a V8 in 2022 (or 2024) but given that they had 10 years to develop it after the release of the 6th gen, it just look plain lazy. And that front fascia looks ridiculous, all squares, all grill, with a face only a mother could love. At least it sounds very good from the factory. It looks like a very good car, but I'm not sure it's worth the ton of extra cash they'll try to squeeze out of people compared to the outgoing model or a nice optioned phase 1 S550. And what is that ""Dark horse"" thing ? Sounds very tacky. It looks like all the marketing naming around that car has been handled by kids.

Front looks like remastered 2005-2013 model(I like it but it is obsolete compared to current competition) with tiny lights, also three stripes which represent the running lights look like they are made for some electric car. Interior is copy paste from other car manufacturers which I personaly don't like, especially those screens that looks like tablets which were introduced in Mercedes back in 2014. Only thing that I like is that they still offer V8 engine with manual. All in all,I feel like they ran out of ideas and options.They should keep it simple because it is muscle car, not familiy van.It must offer raw power, I want to hear V8 roar while cruising,doing burnout ect. I don't want all this electric and  laggy screens showing how low my mpg is and eco tips, at least not in this car. I don't know what this car represents because it pushed away many muscle car lovers like I am and people who want performance are going to buy BMW, Merc or  Audi not this.",2022-09-15T15:25:07Z,1

Yes, it’s great that it has so much functionality, but I feel it has lost some of its character, like losing the dual cowl design, the gauges in the mid section etc. if you took the mustang plaque off from above the glove box, and logo off the wheel, I’m not sure it could be able to be distinguished as a Mustang. Just my opinion. Maybe seeing it in person would change my mind a bit.

I will say, the Dark Horse model is pretty sweet 😎",2022-09-15T13:58:33Z,5
